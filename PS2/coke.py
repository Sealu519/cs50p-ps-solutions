# Coke Machine
# Suppose that a machine sells bottles of Coca-Cola (Coke) for 50 cents and only accepts coins in these
# denominations: 25 cents, 10 cents, and 5 cents.
#
# In a file called coke.py, implement a program that prompts the user to insert a coin, one at a time,
# each time informing the user of the amount due. Once the user has inputted at least 50 cents, output how many cents
# in change the user is owed. Assume that the user will only input integers, and ignore any integer that isnâ€™t an
# accepted denomination.
due, inserted = 50, 0
while inserted < due:
    print("Amount Due:", due - inserted)
    coin = int(input("Insert Coin: "))
    if coin in [5, 10, 25]:
        inserted += coin
print("Change Owed:", inserted - due)
