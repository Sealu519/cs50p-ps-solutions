# camelCase
#
# In some languages, it’s common to use camel case (otherwise known as “mixed case”) for variables’ names when those
# names comprise multiple words, whereby the first letter of the first word is lowercase but the first letter of each
# subsequent word is uppercase. For instance, whereas a variable for a user’s name might be called name, a variable
# for a user’s first name might be called firstName, and a variable for a user’s preferred first name (e.g.,
# nickname) might be called preferredFirstName.
#
# Python, by contrast, recommends snake case, whereby words are instead separated by underscores (_),
# with all letters in lowercase. For instance, those same variables would be called name, first_name,
# and preferred_first_name, respectively, in Python.
#
# In a file called camel.py, implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a variable in camel case and
# outputs the corresponding name in snake case. Assume that the user’s input will indeed be in camel case.
