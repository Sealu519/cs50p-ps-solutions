# Emojize
# Because emoji aren’t quite as easy to type as text, at least on laptops and desktops, some programs support
# “codes,” whereby you can type, for instance, :thumbs_up:, which will be automatically converted to 👍. Some
# programs additionally support aliases, whereby you can more succinctly type, for instance, :thumbsup:, which will
# also be automatically converted to 👍.
# See carpedm20.github.io/emoji/all.html?enableList=enable_list_alias for a list of codes with aliases.
#
# In a file called emojize.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a str in English and then outputs the
# “emojized” version of that str, converting any codes (or aliases) therein to their corresponding emoji.

# pip install emoji

import emoji
text = input("Input: ").strip()
print(emoji.emojize(text))
