# Frank, Ian and Glen’s Letters
# FIGlet, named after Frank, Ian, and Glen’s letters, is a program from the early 1990s
# for making large letters out of ordinary text, a form of ASCII art:
#
#  _ _ _          _   _     _
# | (_) | _____  | |_| |__ (_)___
# | | | |/ / _ \ | __| '_ \| / __|
# | | |   <  __/ | |_| | | | \__ \
# |_|_|_|\_\___|  \__|_| |_|_|___/
# Among the fonts supported by FIGlet are those at figlet.org/examples.html.
#
# FIGlet has since been ported to Python as a module called pyfiglet.
#
# In a file called figlet.py, implement a program that:
#
# Expects zero or two command-line arguments: Zero if the user would like to output text in a random font. Two if the
# user would like to output text in a specific font, in which case the first of the two should be -f or --font,
# and the second of the two should be the name of the font. Prompts the user for a str of text. Outputs that text in
# the desired font. If the user provides two command-line arguments and the first is not -f or --font or the second
# is not the name of a font, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.
