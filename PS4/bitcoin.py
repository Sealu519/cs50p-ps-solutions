# Bitcoin is a form of digitial currency, otherwise known as cryptocurrency. Rather than rely on a central authority
# like a bank, Bitcoin instead relies on a distributed network, otherwise known as a blockchain, to record transactions.
#
# Because thereâ€™s demand for Bitcoin (i.e., users want it), users are willing to buy it, as by exchanging one
# currency (e.g., USD) for Bitcoin.
#
# In a file called bitcoin.py, implement a program that:
#
# Expects the user to specify as a command-line argument the number of Bitcoins, , that they would like to buy. If
# that argument cannot be converted to a float, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message. Queries
# the API for the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index at https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json, which returns a
# JSON object, among whose nested keys is the current price of Bitcoin as a float. Be sure to catch any exceptions,
# as with code like: import requests
#
# try:
#     ...
# except requests.RequestException:
#     ...
# Outputs the current cost of
#  Bitcoins in USD to four decimal places, using , as a thousands separator.

import sys
import requests

try:
    response = requests.get("https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json")
    data = response.json()
    current_price = data["bpi"]["USD"]["rate_float"]
except requests.RequestException:
    sys.exit()


try:
    n = float(sys.argv[1])
except IndexError:
    sys.exit("Missing command-line argument")
except ValueError:
    sys.exit("Command-line argument is not a number")
print(f"${n * current_price:,.4f}")
