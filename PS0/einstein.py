# Even if you havenâ€™t studied physics (recently or ever!), you might have heard that , wherein represents energy (
# measured in Joules), represents mass (measured in kilograms), and represents the speed of light (measured
# approximately as 300000000 meters per second), per Albert Einstein et al. Essentially, the formula means that mass
# and energy are equivalent.
#
# In a file called einstein.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for mass as an integer (in
# kilograms) and then outputs the equivalent number of Joules as an integer. Assume that the user will input an
# integer.

m = int(input('What is the mass?'))
c = 300000000
print('E = ', m*c*c, 'Joules')
