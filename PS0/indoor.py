# WRITING IN ALL CAPS IS LIKE YELLING.

# Best to use your “indoor voice” sometimes, writing entirely in lowercase.
# In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that
# same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. You’re welcome,
# but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.

a = input()
print(a.lower())
